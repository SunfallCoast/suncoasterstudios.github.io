            <p>At Suncoaster Studios, we worked with one of Niagara's largest resort and hospitality groups to enhance their digital presence. Our responsibilities included creating email-based advertisements and ensuring the smooth operation of multiple company websites. Once routine updates were completed, we focused on modernizing their older websites with mobile-friendly redesigns, utilizing WordPress as the primary development platform.</p>
